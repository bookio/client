###Roadmap to first public release

The goal of the system is to work for three categories of reservations:

* Hardware (houses, boats, tools, sport equipment, ..)
* Resources (doctors, therapists, hairdressers, stand-up comedians, ..)
* Activities (Seminars, adventure tours, tastings, courses, ..)

For 1.0 we exclude Activities because this is more complex in handling. Resources will be handled
